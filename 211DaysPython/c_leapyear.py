'''
In this Python challenge, you must create the logic for the is_leap_year function, which determines whether a year is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it meets the following conditions:

It is divisible by 4, but not by 100.
If it is divisible by 100 it must be divisible by 400 as well.
The is_leap_year function receives a single parameter: the year to evaluate. It must return True if the year is a leap year or False otherwise.

Note that the function must be able to handle non-integer or negative values.
